One season -- one microlensing

When using a spline fit, optimizing a polynom corresponds to weighted to linear least squares -- fast !

    A SeasonFct object is one season + a certain polynom (simple poly or legendre for now -- from outside you do not see what it is) + some stuff

    By itself, it makes no sense. It needs to be linked to a lightcurve : this is done by adding it to lc.ml, which is a
    microlensing object, i.e. essentially a list of seasonfct objects.

    The idea is that the number of params and the mask remain fixed for one given seasonfct object.

    So once the instance is made, only the values of the parameters can be updated.
