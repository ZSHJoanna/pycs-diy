    A lightcurve can have such a microlensing object as attribute "ml".
    For now we have only one spline per lightcurve (i.e., no seasons).

    The splml.spline.datapoints are relative, first point is always at 0.0
    That's why we store a jdoffset EDIT : No, we don't store it anymore.
    The spline just starts at 0.0, nobody here cares about this offset... use the timeshift of my lightcurve,
    if you want to know where I am located on an absolute time axis.

    We don't use stabilization points for microlensing splines (not needed I hope)
    Hence, the datapoints.jds are directly the jds - jdoffset from the associated lightcurve
    (They will not change)
    EDIT : we now use stab points, but still, the jds remain fixed.

    The datapoint mags = what has to be added to the lightcurve so that it matches the sourcespline (or something else).
    This is the same convention set as for ML by polynoms.
