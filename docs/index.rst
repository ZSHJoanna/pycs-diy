About
-----

PyCS3 is a software toolbox to estimate time delays between multiple images of strongly lensed quasars, from resolved light curves such as obtained by the `COSMOGRAIL <http://www.cosmograil.org/>`_ monitoring program. It comes in the form of a python package, and heavily depends on ``numpy``, ``scipy``, and ``matplotlib`` for its core functionality. The `repository is on GitLab <https://gitlab.com/vbonvin/PyCS3>`_.

To measure time delays with ``pycs3``, you'll typically write a script calling some high-level functions provided by the package. PyCS allows you to compare different point estimators (including your own), without much code integration. You can follow the `example notebooks <https://gitlab.com/vbonvin/PyCS3/-/tree/master/notebook>`_ to learn how to use the core functionnality of PyCS3.

If you have already read our :doc:`papers<citing>`, you might want to proceed with :doc:`installation`, or the :doc:`tutorial/tutorial`.
