Citing PyCS3 in a publication
=============================

If you want to acknowledge PyCS3 in a publication, we suggest you to cite both the original PyCS paper and the new version of the software presented in the Journal of Open Source Software (JOSS) :

* Tewes et al. 2013

  - `COSMOGRAIL XI: Techniques for time delay measurement in presence of microlensing, A&A 553 A120 <http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361/201220123>`_.
  - This paper describes the original curve-shifting algorithms of PyCS.


* Millon et al. 2020b

  - `PyCS3: A Python toolbox for time-delay measurements in lensed quasars, JOSS 5 53 2654 <https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.02654>`_.
  - This paper briefly describes the functionality of the package


If you make use of the automated time-delay measurement pipeline, please also cite :

* Millon et al. 2020a

  - `COSMOGRAIL XIX: Time delays in 18 strongly lensed quasars from 15 years of optical monitoring <https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.05736>`_.
  - This paper presents the automated version of PyCS3 and apply this technique on large monitoring data set.
